            <p>
              Never lose a request Whether customers reach out over email, chat,
              phone, or any web, mobile, or social channel, every submission
              creates a ticket and enters a queue. Customers get a notification
              to confirm your support team received the request and that help is
              on the way. Meanwhile, robust tools like routing, CSAT ratings,
              time tracking, service level agreements, and more, ensure your
              agents wonâ€™t miss a beat.
